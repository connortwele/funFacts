            <li>The tradition of brewing root beer is thought to have evolved out of other small beer traditions that produced fermented drinks with very low alcohol content that were thought to be healthier to drink than possibly tainted local sources of drinking water.</li>
            <li>European culinary techniques have been applied to making traditional sassafras-based beverages similar to root beer since the 16th century.</li>
            <li>Root beer has been sold in confectionery stores since the 1840s, and written recipes for root beer have been documented since the 1860s. It possibly was combined with soda as early as the 1850s.</li>
